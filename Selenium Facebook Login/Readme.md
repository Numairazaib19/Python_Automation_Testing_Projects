**Project Name: SeleniumFacebookLogin**

## Project Description
This project is a simple automation script that uses the Selenium library to automate the login process on Facebook. The script opens the Facebook login page, enters the specified email and password, and then submits the form to log in. After a brief pause to allow the page to load, it prints the current URL, which should be the URL after a successful login.

## Prerequisites
Before running this script, you need to have the following software installed:

1. Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Selenium library (You can install it using `pip install selenium`)

Also, ensure you have the appropriate version of the Chrome WebDriver (chromedriver) for your Chrome browser version. You can download the appropriate chromedriver from the official website: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

## Important Note
Please make sure to use this script responsibly and only on websites where you have the right permissions.
